Hello! I am in the dual Ph.D. program between the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.tamu.edu/) at the [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) and the [Institute of Statistics and Big Data](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/) at the [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/home1024.html). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xianyang Zhang](https://stat.tamu.edu/~zhangxiany/) and [Prof. Shaojun Guo](https://sites.google.com/site/guoshaojun20170709/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Statistics from the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://maths.whu.edu.cn/) at the [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2016.
