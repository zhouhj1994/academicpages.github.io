I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the dual program between the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.tamu.edu/) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) and the [Institute of Statistics and Big Data](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/) at [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en). I am advised by [Prof. Xianyang Zhang](https://stat.tamu.edu/~zhangxiany/) and [Prof. Shaojun Guo](https://sites.google.com/site/guoshaojun20170709/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Statistics from the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/index.htm) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2016.
